If he has 5-9 Count, he gains 10 {status:Sinking} to raise his Count to 10, so he can spend it. He also adds Indiscriminate, {status:WideAreaRampage}, and +1 atk weight to the skill. This means he chooses one other random target outside of his main target (both allies and enemies), then every coin he uses will hit either one of the two at random. At 5+ {status:Charge} Potency, it stops gaining Indiscriminate, which removes the chance of him selecting allies as the secondary target, but he'll still choose a second target and randomly hit between the two."
