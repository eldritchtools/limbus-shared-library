At 7 stacks, it converts into {status:ContemptRyoshu} next turn, then it flips between the two statuses every turn until either one is consumed. Both statuses are transferred to other enemies if the unit dies while having them unless they're consumed by her S3-2.",
      "If enemies collectively have 7+ total {status:GazeRyoshu} or at least 1 enemy has {status:ContemptRyoshu}, her S3 triggers S3-2 instead. S3-2 has 3 atk weight and prioritizes enemies with either status as sub-targets (sub-targets receive 50% damage and the main target receives 200% damage if it's the only target). Her S3-2 will consume all {status:GazeRyoshu} and {status:ContemptRyoshu} on the targets hit, significantly increasing damage dealt, especially to enemies with {status:ContemptRyoshu}.",

She gains 1 stack for every 2 {status:GazeRyoshu} and 3 stacks for every {status:ContemptRyoshu} consumed. If she gains 7 {status:GazePersonality}, it converts into {status:ContemptPersonality} on the following turn, but expires otherwise. To get the 7 stacks you need to consume a total of 14 {status:GazeRyoshu} between the 3 targets, with each {status:ContemptRyoshu} counting as 6.",
