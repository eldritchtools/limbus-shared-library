      "Starts out the battle with 0 {status:HanafudaCombo} Potency and 3 Count as well as a random 'Suit in Hand' buff ({status:HanafudaOne}, {status:HanafudaTwo}, {status:HanafudaThree}).",
      "Think of the Potency as the number of points she has and the Count as a timer for her to reach 5 points. Every turn, the Count goes down by 1, and if it's 0 when she uses a skill, her passive mechanic triggers at the end of the skill. When this happens, if she has less than 3 points, she just gets 2 {status:Enhancement} then {status:HanafudaCombo} resets to 0/3. If she has 3+ points, she uses her S3-2 as an unopposed attack.",
      "Her S3-2 consumes all her {status:HanafudaCombo} to deal more damage and gain an extra Coin per stack/point she had. If she had 5, she also triggers {status:VibrationExplosion} twice on the last coin. After that, next turn her Hand randomizes its color and she resets to 0/3. If she didn't use up all her coins, she starts her next 'round' with points equal to the number of coins she didn't use instead of 0.",
      "Each of the following will give her one point (only counts for her leftmost skill slot):\n- Use a skill with an affinity that matches her current suit ({keyword:Wrath} for {status:HanafudaOne}, {keyword:Sloth} for {status:HanafudaTwo}, {keyword:Gloom} for {status:HanafudaThree}). This counts both her base skills and E.G.Os\n- Use her S3 or an E.G.O skill\n- Match her current suit 2 turns in a row\nMeeting multiple conditions at the same time will give her a point for each condition, and you can tell how many points she got in a turn with the card visual and sound effect that happens when she uses her skill.",
      "In addition to generating points, her leftmost skill will also convert her Hand to the suit matching that skill's affinity next turn, and if she matched her current suit, she triggers a {status:VibrationExplosion} and has a 25% chance to generate an extra E.G.O resource for the skill she used.",
