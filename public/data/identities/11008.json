On Clash Win with his S3, he consumes {status:Breath} Count to generate Potency and, if he was the only one targetting that skill slot, inflicts {status:Vulnerable} on the target. He generates the {status:Breath} Count he uses on his S1 and S2.\n\nWith his passive active, he gains max speed based on {status:Breath} Count, and if all his allies are faster than all the enemies, he gains {status:PenetrateDamageUp}.\n\nAll his skills gain Coin Power from speed difference against his target making his speed buffs important to get."
