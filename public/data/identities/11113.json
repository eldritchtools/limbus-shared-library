She then consumes all her Count to gain Coin Power and damage on the last coin.\n\nHer S2 inflicts {status:Switch_Vibration} into {status:VibrationChainPersonality} if the target isn't already in {status:Switch_Vibration}, reducing the enemy's Clash Power by 1 for every 10 {status:Vibration} Potency up to a max of -3, while still working with any other usual effects of {status:Vibration}. Otherwise, it deals more damage.\n\nHer first S3 use additionally gives her {status:OutisNoHat} for the rest of the encounter, giving her more {status:Vibration} Count generation and damage.\n\nWhen her passive is active, she gets a free heal if she has 10-20% HP at turn end.
