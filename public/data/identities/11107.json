It also changes its atk weight to the value of her stacks, but she loses 5 SP per stack above 1 and if her SP hits 10 or lower, she has a 50% chance to attack indiscriminately. This means at 7 stacks, she needs to be at 41 or above SP for her not to attack indiscriminately. It will also consume all her {status:FreischutzShotCount} if she uses it at 7 stacks. This counts as 'spending' her last ammo for any relevant passives from other identities.\n\nHer skills also inflict {status:DarkFlame} (1 from S1, and equal to her {status:FreischutzShotCount} stacks for S2 and S3), which inflicts {status:DefenseDown} and {keyword:Pride} damage based on {status:Combustion} Potency depending on the stacks of {status:DarkFlame}.\n\nHer passive gives her {status:Breath} before attacking based on the enemy's {status:Combustion} if they have 4 or more {status:DefenseDown}.\n\n{ego:21108} interacts with her mechanics, generating {status:FreischutzShotCount} based on Reson and inflicting {status:DarkFlame}."
