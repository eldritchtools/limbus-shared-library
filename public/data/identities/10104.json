He has a lot of coins and doesn't inflict much Count on his own, so he needs other sinners/EGOs to maintain the stack before he can nuke the boss.\n\nHe also gains {status:Vibration} Count from S1(+3) and S3(+6), which he can consume with S2(-6) to convert it to a 3 atk weight aoe.\n\nIf he has 10+ {status:Vibration} Count, his S3 deals bonus damage. Since this check happens on hit and he gains 6 Count on use, you can get the bonus as long as he has at least 4 Count at the start of the turn."
