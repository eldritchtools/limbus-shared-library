Further turns spent defending will just hold the arrow, but not make it stronger. Using any attack skill while charging will automatically replace it with her S3-2, an unclashable attack used at combat start. The skill is buffed depending on what skill was consumed providing more Base Power, Coin Power, and bonus damage the higher tier the skill is. At max charge, the replaced skill is considered to be an S3 regardless of what it was.",
