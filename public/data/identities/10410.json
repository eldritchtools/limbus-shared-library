S3-2 inflicts additional {status:Laceration}, deals more damage, and heals more HP and SP for herself and an ally based on how much of the two Charges she consumed (base S3 does the same but with lower values and without consuming either Charge). Using it with Res also increases the number of allies healed. It also inflicts {status:Binding} and {status:Reduction} next turn. After using S3-2, she gains {status:Emptiness} preventing her from building either Charge versions for a turn. Gaining {status:RedEyeFirst} will instead heal her and an ally's HP, while gaining {status:PenanceFirst} heals their SP. Both versions will drain her SP by 15 on use."
