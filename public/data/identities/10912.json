It also gives her additional {status:Burst} application on her S1 and Clash Power on her S3. Her S2's final coin also lets her generate an extra stack of the buff on crit.\n\nHer S2 and S3 both get Coin reuses based on {status:Breath}, with the S2 gaining it at 30+ Potency by consuming 10 and the S3 gaining it on crit with her last coin.\n\nHer S2 inflicts {status:BurstPoison} which applies {status:AttackDown} and {status:DefenseDown} on the enemy whenever their {status:Burst} stack is triggered by a crit up to 5 times. When the debuff is fully consumed, it deals additional {keyword:Gluttony} damage based on the enemy's {status:Burst} Potency.\n\nHer S3 is an {status:WideAreaRampage} with atk weight 3, which means it picks 2 targets along with its main target, then each coin on her attack will choose a random target from the 3 to hit.\n\nHer passive increases her damage dealt slightly when she has {status:SnakeStance} or if the enemy has {status:BurstPoison}\n\nHer buff for {identity:10613} gives him {status:Burst} application on crit (3 per turn)."
