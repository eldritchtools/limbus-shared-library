Her conditionals are dependent on her speed difference from her target's, so she'll always need {status:LegStrength} to be active. Her passive just gives bonus damage if she has {status:LegStrength} or if her target has {status:BurstAgility}.\n\n{status:BurstAgility} inflicts {status:Burst} Count on the target if a unit with 10+ speed triggers {status:Burst} on it up to 3 times, then deals bonus {keyword:Gluttony} damage on it based on its {status:Burst} when all 3 times are consumed. It basically prevents its {status:Burst} Count from going down for those 3 hits. Any additional applications of {status:BurstAgility} won't work until it's fully consumed.\n\nHer buff for {identity:10613} is +5% bonus damage if his speed is faster than his target's."
